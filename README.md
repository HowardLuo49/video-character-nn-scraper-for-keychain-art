# video-character-nn-scraper-for-keychain-art

This test project seeks to more efficiently procure image art for keychain production.

The idea is to allow users to generate large quantities of specific cartoon/anime character images using video input with the help of a neural network classifier.

Using just the first episode of a show can generate sufficient trianing data for most puroses.

This tool can also be tuned to track and output the timestamps when a particular character shows up on screen in a given video.

Due to copyright concerns only a small sample subset is included for demonstration purposes.
